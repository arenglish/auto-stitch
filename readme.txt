This jupyter notebook was built on my local machine with the python and package environment specified in the notebook.
When trying to import into colab, I encountered many issues with library interfaces and mismatches even after ensuring the right cv2 and python version.
If possible, it would be best to install the environment file using anaconda on a local machine, if the libraries are not already available and run it locally.
If all else fails, I recorded the output of the program into main.pdf
